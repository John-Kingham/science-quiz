                            (in-game instructions will be provided for each
                            one).

                            With each correct answer, your score will increase
                            from 100 points up to a maximum of ONE MILLION.

                            When you reach 1000 and 32000 points, your points
                            will be "safe" and cannot be lost.

                        <li>
                            If you answer a question incorrectly your score will
                            fall to the last "safe" level (or zero if you
                            haven't reached a safe level you).

                            You can exit at any time with your current score,
                            which is handy if you don't know the answer to a
                            question and have run out of Lifelines.
